In this project we will create a database in microsoft SQL server management studio, clean and analyze the data. after complete analysis we will then visualize the data through Power Bi


Introduction:

Cyclistic is a Bike-Sharing company based in Chicago that possess more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic users are more likely to use their bikes for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute for work each day. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. The company offers single day passes, full day passes for a price for casual users, and prove an annual subscription fee for its members. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
Cyclistic has concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Therefore, maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, they believe creating a marketing campaign solely focused on casual users would help convert casual users into members. The company has set a clear goal of designing marketing strategies aimed at converting casual users into members. In order to do so they need to better understand the difference between how casual users differ from subscribed members and interest in analyzing the historical bike data trip to help identify trends.


Problem statement:

The Company's analysts have inferred that annual members are much more profitable for the company than casual users, so they believe that the key of the company's future is depended upon maximizing the number of annual memberships.
The business-related problem statements that could be asked to improve the company's growth rate and success is shared below:
1.	How do casual users and annual subscribed members use Cyclistic Bikes differently?
2.	How can we design new marketing strategies to help convert casual members into annual members?


Conclusion:

After performing the collection, transformation, cleaning, organisation and analysis of the given 13 datasets, we have enough factual evidence to suggest answers to the business-related questions that were asked.
We can infer that casual users are more likely to use their bikes for a longer duration of time. Casual users are also more inclined to ride during evening hours of 3:00PM - 7PM and weekends is when most of the casual users prefer to ride. While user traffic for both groups are highest during the months of summer, the months of winter is when user traffic significantly drops for both types.
In order to design new marketing strategies to better focus on and suit the casual users to help convert them into buying annual memberships, we have to refer to the analysis provided above and keep those facts in mind. The recommendations I would provide to help solve this business-related scenario is shown below.

Top Recommendations to Marketing Strategists:

•	Implement advertising annual memberships prices more using billboards/posters near the top 20 most popular stations for casual users.
•	Provide a limited discount on annual memberships purchased during the months of lowest traffic to increase rider usage in these months.
•	Have frequent advertisements on social media and television during peak hours and peak months, since that is when most people have a thought about riding bikes.
•	Consider provide free ride minutes for every minute passed after 30 minutes of usage, where the free minutes can ONLY be redeemed on weekdays to help promote rider usage during weekdays
